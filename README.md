# Reading From The Project

The application is all in main.py

# Running The Project

My submission includes one python script "main.py" and two csv files. 
These csv files are custom datasets that you can load into the application. If you plan on running the project, I recommend using pycharm but vscode should also work, 
I also recommend setting up a virtual environment first and then pip installing the necessary packages (PySimpleGUI, pandas, transformers). 
Afterwards you can just run the main.py file, it will take a moment to load the application. 
You can then load the datasets into the app to see how it works or enter your own text in the "Enter your review" field.

One important thing to mention, if you plan on loading your own datasets just make sure they are csv files and the column name for your reviews is labeled as review and ratings (if any) as rating.
